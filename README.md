# raytracing
This was a C++ program I made years ago realizing 2D ray tracing for imaging systems. 
This program was created under Qt. https://www.qt.io/developers/
To use it, please do following steps first :
1) put qt5core.dll file under sys64WOW and system32 folder in C:\windows\.
2) set environment variables (in windows systems, you can find it at "advanced properties")
3) set lens parameters of your imaging system in try.txt file. (you can find it in "bin" folder).
** Note: don't delete the first row of try.txt.
